# Helicopter Chair Fly Trainer (MVP)

This is a Python-based desktop training tool to help student pilots to practice startup & shutdown checklists, emergency procedures, 
radio communication flows, and establish "mental picture" in a "chair flying" environment — without the cost and risk of real flight time,
using an interactive cockpit mock — based on the Robinson R22 panel layout.

## Features (MVP)
- Simulated cockpit panel (using Python & PySide6)
- Toggleable switches
- Visual indicators
- Emergency lights
- Ability to save/load aircraft and airport related information to file
- Startup & shutdown procedures practice

## Built With
- Python
- PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- Qt Designer
- Designed for touchscreen & mouse input
- PyInstaller (for `.exe` bundling)
- (Stretch) gTTS / pyttsx3 for voice output

## Status
🚧 Work in Progress.
